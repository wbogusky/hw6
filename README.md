I was really inspired by the Musical Bounces project shown in class. I'd like to design something similar, but with a more rigid and repetitive rhythmic structure.

I've begun by drawing the basic structure over which other (maybe 5ish) shapes will animate.
Each shape should randomly generate its own motion and sound properties at the beginning of the sketch.
Once this is done, each shape will move from grid square to grid square according to its particular behavior.
When the shapes meet each other and occupy one grid square, each of their corresponding sounds will play.
